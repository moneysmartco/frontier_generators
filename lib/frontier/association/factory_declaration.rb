  # We use the :build strategy by default. Otherwise FG will persist the association
  # even when we build the parent object.
  #
  # This is almost always problematic. Why persist children if we don't necessarily
  # want to persist the parent? EG: In a spec where we are trying to avoid
  # hitting the DB for performance reasons.
  #
  # If we build the associations, they will be persisted when we save the parent
  # object anyway.
